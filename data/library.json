      "big_idea": "Marriage is not an accident; it is a design. Scripture shows God creating marriage for companionship, calling spouses to a posture of mutual submission, and pointing to love that moves first. When a home follows God’s pattern, it becomes a clear witness through daily conduct, not merely words.",

      "big_idea": "In Exodus, God makes His Name known as a lasting memorial for every generation, and He is celebrated as a mighty warrior. In the New Testament, Jesus is given the Name above every name, and God’s power is seen in extraordinary healings as people come near in faith. The same Scriptures also call believers to respond with a distinct posture—blessing even in the face of persecution.",

God promises His redeemed people His presence through deep waters and fire, and He is an everlasting refuge. But pride can sabotage a restart—Scripture warns that God resists the proud, humbles the arrogant, and gives grace and restoration to the humble.",
