      "big_idea": "Marriage is not an accident; it is a design. Scripture shows God creating marriage for companionship, calling spouses to a posture of mutual submission, and pointing to love that moves first. When a home follows God’s pattern, it becomes a clear witness through daily conduct, not merely words.",

      "big_idea": "When pressure rises, the temptation is to stop praying—but Scripture points the other way. God reigns over kings, circumstances, and every obstacle, and His power is not limited by what we see. This study traces biblical reasons to keep praying with confidence, seeking God as refuge and trusting His authority to answer.",
